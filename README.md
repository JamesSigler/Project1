Screen for when the user first steps infront the mirror. This is the screen that the user will be presented with when they first use the mirror. From here they can access the rest of the functions by clicking on any of the widgets.
## After

 When widgets are pressed and full functions are revealed and accessible by the user. Things that are reveald are functions such as being able to write texts, recording video and taking pictures. you will also be able to zoom when clicking on the magnifying glass and if you press the settings button you will be able to change the layout of the widgets and other things.
  
## 3) 
   ~~The project is in the early stages of development at this time and is not anywhere near operational~~
   
   Project is completely functional.
   
##  4)
   Our plan to move forward is to gather the necessary information on how to properly implement the current planned functions. After all      the information is gatherd the next step is to systymatically move forward with the weather and date/time functions along with other        similar functions like music. this will be followed by a zoom and picture function. After the picture function the settings function        will have to be added. Finally a filter and text function will hopefully be implemented.

##    Mirror Picture:

Our plan from the beginning was to go for simplicity while still having a reason to have a smart mirror. Our idea was that a mirror should be a mirror. There should be no reason to watch videos or surf the web while standing in front of a mirror.

When we first started we knew for sure that we wanted to add the filters and camera functions because that would be the average use of a smart mirror. We were able to implement the filters perfectly with the camera, but due to a shift in frameworks we were not able to re-adjust the camera to be usable by the deadline. 

We have the most basic functionalities working well too. Time and date are working as intended, it just works. Similarlly, out weather and news apps work as they are supposed to with almost no errors.

There was some problems with the implementation of the calender there was trouble fitting it in, trouble with the display, etc. but we made enough tweaks to make it useable for what it is intended to do. Although we did not originally plan of adding Spotify we later thought it would be a good idea since it does not require someone to stand at the mirror constantly. There were similar issues with Spotify as the calender but after tweas it was made functional and does not require any more changes that we could see.

There were things that we wanted to implement but were either too complicated or too arbitrary to add to a simulated mirror. For example, we ditched text messages to mirror implementations because of complications with both bluetooth and phone emulations. Another example, we thought about having a physical mirror to camera display which could be interchanged at a user convinence, but on further discussion there was both no point of it and it wouldent make sense for an already camera based mirror. Things like this were not that much of a problem though because although we did not implement all of our planned features, we implemented at least 3 extra features that were not planned.
