  4) The project is in the early stages of development at this time and is not anywhere near operational
  
  5) our plan to move forward is to gather the necessary information on how to properly implement the current planned functions. After all      the information is gatherd the next step is to systymatically move forward with the weather and date/time functions along with other        similar functions like music. this will be followed by a zoom and picture function. After the picture function the settings function        will have to be added. Finally a filter and text function will hopefully be implemented.
